# AI-Simulator

#### Basic concept  

The goal of this project is to learn and implement AI related stuffs like 
nn's playing against each other and make it observable to watch their way to learn.
I want to make games playable by users too against ai and for sure the games will be available
 to play simple PvP without any Ai but it's not that fun.
